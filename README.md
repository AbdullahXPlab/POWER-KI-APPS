# POWER-KI APPS
 A diversified collection of applications created with POWER-KI during my stage at XPlab. (2023)
If you want to use my programs you will have to download this program: [POWER-KI](https://github.com/POWER-KI).
Once you have downloaded POWER-KI from the link, download the program you like and finally open it.
