# Arduino-Temperatura-01
It is a program that shows you the temperatures of the environment and
of an object that are detected thanks to an infrared temperature sensor
connected to the Arduino which sends the signal to the application.
In the program there are also 3 rectangles which indicate whether the
temperature is high, low or normal (red, blue, green, with shades).
There are also 2 trackbars that show the temperature as if it were
a thermostat.
